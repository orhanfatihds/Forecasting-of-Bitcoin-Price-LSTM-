# Forecasting-of-Bitcoin-Price-LSTM-
I am Forecasting of Bitcoin Prices using LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)in USD. These predictions are made on a daily basis and I take 90 percent of data for forecasting
and 10 percent for testing purposes.
This is my Bachelor Thesis work. I am also predicting the Bitcoin prices using ARIMA model. 
The goal is to test which model is more suitable for me to predict the prices and compare them.
